AQI stands for Air Quality Index, which is used by the government Agencies to tell the people about the quality of air by measuring the pollutant level present in the air.
  As the AQI increases,the problem of Air Pollution arises i.e., contamination of air due to the harmful substances present in the air which are hazardous to living beings.
  
  
  
The National Air Quality Index(AQI) was launched in New Delhi on September 17,2014;under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.AQI is determined and calculated by the Central Pollution Control Board(CPCB).

## AQI Calculation

To determine air quality in an area, pollutants concentration are physically measured and reported.The AQI is calculated based on the average concentration of a particular pollutants measured over a standard time interval.(24 hours for most pollutants, 8 hours for Carbon monoxide(CO) and ozone(O3).Now, on the behalf of AQI calculated, it is assigned category to know about the quality.This category is already determined.

## Problem Statement:
- With the rapid industrialization and development, AQI is worsening day by day, where national capital is becoming dangerous place to live.
- In this project,it was about forecasting AQI, in order to take appropriate measure.
- Which sector causes more pollution?
- Which state contributes most hazardous policies.
- Reason of SMOG in Delhi.
- Telling measures and situation as per AQI.
- Feature of Machine learning model.
- 5 most polluted and least city.

## Methodology:
### - How I Solve:
-By creating a time series model to forecast the value and through visualization.

### - Tools used:
- Python and its library, along with ML Algorithm and Time Series Analysis.
- Visualization: Tableau and Python Library.

### - Challanges:
- Large Dataset and null values.


## Conclusion:

1. Delhi is having smog during winters due to reason is increase of PM2.5 and PM10 i.e in winters people burn wood and coal to warm themselves, use of heater and main reason is stubble burning in the area near it.
